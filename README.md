Example code using Bugfender in Swift iOS.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bugfender/BugfenderSDK-iOS-swift-sample.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bugfender/BugfenderSDK-iOS-swift-sample)

## How to Build

- In order to build this example you need to install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) to download the needed dependencies (libraries) for this example.
- Once you have CocoaPods installed, go to the project's root and type in Terminal:
`pod install`
- Always open `BugfenderSDK-iOS-swift-sample.xcworkspace`, not the project alone, as this project needs all libraries downloaded by CocoaPods (and they're reference in the Workspace)
